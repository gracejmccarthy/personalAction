        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>Here is a very long paragraph that explains the rest. I am assuming that this is going to be pretty long so I
        am going to just type very random wordsssssss. I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to format this page so that
        3 images were on the top and 2 images were on the bottom. I don't know why it has taken me so long... I feel like this
        should be fairly simple. I think the reason why I am having trouble is because I used other code as inspiration for this
        format but I'm not using all of it so now I just have these random divs that are messing everything up and I am too afraid
        to change it because I don't want to mess up what I already have.... :/ Hopefully this is a long enough paragraph. </p>
